# Ar-Ding-Nition
# 2-Stroke Arduino ignition
This project is halted.


Before reading:
- This is my first project written on the Arduino.
- I have no prior experience of C++ or ignition systems.
- Unfinished, still tons of things left to do in the code.
- Stopped the project at problems with the board freezing at random. But engine running ok at lower RPM.

Purpose of the project:
*Low cost.
*2 Stroke Tuning.
*Simple configuration.
*Homebrew with parts laying around.
*Minimal effort with the capability to have a sparktable.


This code looks for the missing tooth, calculating the crank degree. Looks up a sparktable and fire the desire signal when i position.
