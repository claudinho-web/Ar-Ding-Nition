# 2-Stroke-Arduino-Missing-Tooth-Ignition
This project is under development.

My first big coding project, so no guarantees.

This code looks for the missing tooth, calculating the crank degree. Looks up a sparktable and fire the desire signal when i position.

+- 1-2 degrees of precision with a very badly built testrig.
